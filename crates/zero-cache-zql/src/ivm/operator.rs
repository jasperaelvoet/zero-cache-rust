//! Port of the pure data shapes from `zql/src/ivm/operator.ts`,
//! `zql/src/ivm/data.ts`'s `Node`, and the operator-level `Change` from
//! `zql/src/ivm/change.ts`.
//!
//! **Scope deviation, RESOLVED:** upstream wires operators into a graph via
//! `Input.setOutput(output: Output)`/`Output.push()` — a mutable observer
//! graph where each node holds a trait-object reference to its downstream
//! neighbor. For a single-table filtered query (`TableSource` wrapped by
//! `Filter`) this port modeled v1 as concrete composition instead — an
//! explicit `push`/`fetch` call chain, deferring the graph shape "until
//! `Join` needs a real multi-consumer fan-out" (this doc's own words, for
//! several rounds). `Join` now exists (`crate::ivm::join::Join`) and DOES
//! need real fan-out (one child-table change can affect a join feeding
//! multiple downstream consumers — e.g. a query result AND a permission
//! check watching the same join), so the decision is made: the [`Output`]
//! trait below, held as `Rc<dyn Output>` (not `Rc<RefCell<dyn Output>>` —
//! see that trait's doc for why the `RefCell` moved inside implementors
//! instead of wrapping the trait object). `TableSource`/`Filter` keep their
//! existing direct `push`-returns-`Change` API unchanged (nothing before
//! `Join` needed the graph, so nothing before it was forced to adopt it);
//! `Join` is the first operator that actually registers downstream
//! `Output`s and fans a single incoming change out to all of them.
//!
//! **`Stream`/`'yield'`, resolved:** upstream's `fetch()` returns
//! `Stream<Node | 'yield'>`, a JS generator that can yield the literal
//! string `'yield'` mid-iteration purely so a long-running fetch doesn't
//! block the event loop (a single-threaded-runtime concern). Rust iterators
//! are already lazy/pull-based — the caller controls pacing simply by not
//! calling `.next()` — so there is no `'yield'` signal to carry; `Stream<T>`
//! here is just `Box<dyn Iterator<Item = T> + 'a>`.
//!
//! `relationships` on `Node` is now populated (see `ivm::join`), with one
//! deliberate simplification: upstream generates each relationship
//! LAZILY via a `() -> Stream<Node | 'yield'>` thunk (a join's children
//! are only actually fetched if a caller reads that key). This port
//! stores relationships EAGERLY as a materialized `Vec<Node>` instead —
//! there's no thunk/generator machinery to defer through once `Stream` is
//! just `Box<dyn Iterator>` (see above), and every relationship this port
//! populates today comes from an already-fetched, already-in-memory
//! `TableSource` fetch, so laziness buys nothing yet. Revisit if a
//! relationship ever gets expensive enough to want to skip computing it
//! for an unread key.
//!
//! Not ported in this slice: `Child` changes (joins — see `ivm::join`'s
//! module doc for exactly how far incremental join maintenance goes),
//! `Storage`, `SourceSchema.columns`/`system`/`isHidden` (not needed until
//! a real column-typed source or permissions system exists).
